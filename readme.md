2\. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

You can create a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

On macOS/Linux:

bash

Copy code

python3 -m venv venv

source venv/bin/activate

On Windows:

bash

Copy code

python -m venv venv

.\venv\Scripts\activate

3\. Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install the required Python packages:

bash

Copy code

pip install -r requirements.txt

If the requirements.txt file doesn’t exist, you can create it by running:

bash

Copy code

pip freeze > requirements.txt

4\. Open the Project in PyCharm

Open PyCharm and click on "Open".

Select the folder containing your project.

If prompted, choose to use the virtual environment you created earlier.

5\. Configure the Python Interpreter

Go to File > Settings > Project: <your-project-name> > Python Interpreter.

Click the gear icon and select "Add Interpreter".

Choose "Existing Environment" and browse to the Python interpreter inside your venv folder:

On macOS/Linux: venv/bin/python

On Windows: venv\Scripts\python.exe

Click OK to apply the changes.

6\. Run the Code

Open the main Python file (e.g., main.py).

Click Run > Run..., and select the Python file to execute.

The output will appear in the Run tab at the bottom of PyCharm.

7\. (Optional) Use Google Colab

If you want to run the code on Google Colab, upload the files and install dependencies by running:

python

Copy code

!pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

Install Dependencies: Follow the instructions to install dependencies using pip.

Configure Interpreter: Set the correct interpreter in PyCharm for smooth execution.

Run Code Locally: Use the Run option to execute the code directly in PyCharm.

Optional Cloud Execution: If needed, execute the code on Google Colab.

Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

Ensure the virtual environment is activated before installing packages.

Verify the Python interpreter is correctly set in PyCharm.

Check if all required packages are listed in requirements.txt.
